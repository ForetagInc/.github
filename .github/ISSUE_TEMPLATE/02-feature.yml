          description: What are the alternative solutions? Can this be solved in a different way?
          placeholder: |
              The problem could be solved by:
              - Creating an external plugin
              - Integrating the feature directly into the codebase

              Some tips:
              - Include as much detail about the implementation and pros and cons of each approach
              - Timebox, where possible
              - Add sample pseudo code, where possible
